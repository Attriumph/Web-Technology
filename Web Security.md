# Web Secutity
## 1.Some common ways that websites get infected are (ref [6])
* Cross-site scripting attacks (XSS) 

*	SQL injection attacks :	These attacks maliciously alter the backend databases of websites thus making them redirect users to malware sites.
*	Search Engine result Redirection
*	Attacks on backend virtual hosting companies
*	Using social networking sites to infect users (these are a combination of social engineering and above attacks)

## 2.users can get the malware planted by hackers in many ways

*	By installing “fake codecs” embedded with Trojans. 
*	By viewing “malicious advertisements”
*	By installing “fake scanners” or “misleading applications” (also called scareware/ rogueware).
*	By visiting malicious P2P sites and downloading malicious content
*	By visiting websites sent as email links by the hacker
*	By visiting links posted on “Blog Sites” under “Blog Comments”
*	By installing pirated software from warez sites which are maliciously modified by hackers.

## 3.Attack Categories:
* Authentication Attack: Brute force, insufficient authentication, weak password recovery validation,
* Authorization Attacks: Credential / Session Prediction (Session Hijacking), CRSF
* Client-side Attack: Browser and Plugin Vulnerabilities,XSS, clickjacking,
* Injection Attacks: Search Worms, Js Hijacking, SQL injection,
* Recent Attacks: Worms(Stuxent), Email Hack, Account Breaches(HeartBleed bug: allows stealing the information protected by SSL/TLS encryption), Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks

## 4.important defination:
* Credential/Session prediction is a method of hijacking or impersonating a web site user. 
* Clickjacking’ is a method used by malicious individuals to trick users into clicking something without them knowing what theyve clicked.
* SQL injection: attacks maliciously alter the backend databases of websites thus making them redirect users to malware sites

* Browser and Plugin Vulnerabilities :Loosely defined, these are vulnerabilities in the client browser software or client plugins (Flash/Macromedia/Acrobat etc.) that can either enable other attacks, can enable execution of arbitrary code, raise privileges, compromise users privacy or simply crash the browser.
* Injection Attacks occurs when an application does not properly validate user supplied input and then includes that input blindly in further processing
* 	JavaScript Hijacking allows an attacker to bypass the Same Origin Policy in the case that a Web application uses JavaScript to communicate confidential information. 
* Search worms  automate finding of vulnerable web servers by sending carefully crafted queries to search engines.(add load + evade detection mechanism) eg. MyDoom, santy
*	DDos: which occurs when a system is overwhelmed by malicious electronic traffic.
