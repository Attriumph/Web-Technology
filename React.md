# Intrduction to React

## What is it?
React is a view layer library, not a framework like Backbone, Angular etc.

## Why React developed?
* Complexity of two-way data binding
* A lot of data on a page changing over time

## Why use it?
* Easy to understand what a component will render
* Easy to mix HTML and JS
* Uses full power of JS
* No complex two-way data flow
* React is fast!
* React dev tools
* Server-side rendering

## What is JSX?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript.

## Difference between State and props
State:
      Internal data
      Can be changed
      Private for component 
Props:
      External data
      Can’t be changed

## React VS React Native
React (a.k.a. ReactJS or React.js) is is a JavaScript library you use for building dynamic, high performing, responsive UI
for your web interfaces.
React Native is an entire platform allowing you to build native, cross-platform mobile apps.
React.js is the heart of React Native, and it embodies all React’s principles and syntax, so the learning curve is easy.

## Install React native
npm install -g create-react-native-app
create-react-native-app MyApp
cd MyApp
npm start
npm run ios (for iOS emulator)
npm run android (for android emulator)
